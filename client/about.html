      <div class="aboutBio"><p class="bioHead" style="font-size: 20px;">Welcome to my senior project for Fredonia University's Computer Science program.</p> <br> This project aims to correlate your physical presentation with your music listening preferences, a correlation that you may or not be aware of. The point is not to tell you what you like, rather to tell you what you donâ€™t yet like.<br><br> I started this project at the beginning of the Spring 2023 semester with no knowledge of the machine learning process and very minimal Python skills. By the end of the semester I had gained a solid understanding of how machine learning works and how to utilize Python for data science.<br> The end goal of the project is to produce a functional mobile application that can learn your appearance and music preferences over time, and provide you with insight about yourself that you might not otherwise be made aware of. <br> </div>
